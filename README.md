<!-- Escape Character Rule using Backslash -->

This is an example of a *text with an asterisk*. When we don't want i t to be italicized. We want to use the backslash to escape the rule of using an opening \*asterisk* and closing \*asterisk* to enclose the text contents.

<!-- Blockquote Rule -->

>We use the greater than symbol to display a block of text as a quote with a background and line on the left side.

> *"You don't have to be great to start, but you need to start to be great."* - __Unknwon Author__

<!-- Link Rule -->

**NOTE**: We would want to put the link description inside of square brackets and the link to the resource inside of two open and close parenthesis.
